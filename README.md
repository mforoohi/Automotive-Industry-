# Car_Dealership
 Group 3 Project is to evaluate the impact COVID 19 had on the automotive sales industry, and uncover sales trends that would lead to maximum profitability for current dealerships in the future.
 ## Questions for Analysis

2. What current car sales trends can point to the ideal inventory?

3. Did COVID have an equal effect on car sales based on location at a state level?

4. What are other potential factors affecting current car prices?
